## Meghan Schaefer Front-End Dev Test

#### 1.I built this website using HTML,CSS, Javascript and Python flask framework. I did have references from a few sites to assist with the javascript for the carousel and the animations!

#### 2. My biggest struggle with this project and something I'd like to gain more experience with is accurately making the site mobile responsive.

### 3. I enjoyed following the mock up most as I like to compare my work to the final product and stay creative !
